# PWA Text Editor -J.A.T.E

This is web text editor application that meets the PWA criteria The application can also be installed on computer or mobile device to be used outside of the browser. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.
The integrated service worker and Cache API's ensure that the application will remain fully functional even without active internet connection.

To build this text editor, we have implemented methods for getting and storing data to an database. J.A.T.E uses the idb package which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API.

IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage and when user enters any code or text, it will save automatically whenever you click off of the DOM window. On refresh or revisit, the text is persistent and can be retrieved from IndexedDB.
